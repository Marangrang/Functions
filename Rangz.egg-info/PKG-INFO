Description: mypackage
        A simple library for efficiently solving recursive expressions and sorting.
        
        Brief intro
        This library works in a similar way an interpreter does. Its singularity is that what it interprets is a special kind of language: algebra.
        
        It allows you to cast, from simple strings that represent equations, complex and rich mathematical objects, with their own attributes and properties. It's focused on efficiency and simplicity, and because of that it is easy to use, and implementing it represents no cost to the program.
        
        What can I do with it?
        mypackage began as a array handler, and ended up being much more. Working with fibonacci or factorials, reversing of all kinds of words, bubble sorting of arrays and merging sorted arrays and quick sorting through an array.
        
        If you want to see how mypackage works, refer to /docs/sample_code.md on this repository, where you'll find some very simple examples of how mypackage looks like.
        
        Requirements
        The only requirement for using the library are having Python 3.x and matplotlib library installed (the last is installed by default in most GNU/Linux distros so no problems there).
        
        Installation
        To install the library for Python 3 use pip on your terminal.
        
        pip3 install mypackage --user
        You are good to go now!
